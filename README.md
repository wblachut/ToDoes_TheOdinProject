# ToDo_TheOdinProject
 To does (The Odin Project)
 
 Project is using LocalStorage to save appliaction state.
 Application does not allow project removing so far.

to fix:
- multiple editing option
by:
 + removing eventListeners from edit buttons after one of them is clicked
 + saving only task for which save button was clicked

possible upgrades:
- removing projects
- add "done" option for bullets in checklist to further use and save crossing out for finished things in task checklist
- add date-fns to have some nice timing features
